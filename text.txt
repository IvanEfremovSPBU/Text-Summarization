Scientists find the biggest coral ever. It is in the Pacific Ocean. The coral is 34 meters long, bigger than a blue whale.

It may be over 300 years old. Scientists find it during a trip to study the ocean and climate change. They first think that it is a shipwreck. There is a big meeting about climate change right now. Small countries worry because warming oceans kill coral reefs. But this coral is still alive. Scientists want to study it to learn why it does not die. There is hope that not all coral reefs will die.
